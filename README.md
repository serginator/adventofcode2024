Advent of Code 2024
===================

This is my repo for the Advent of Code 2024. I will be solving the puzzles in Golang this year to improve my skills in the language.

To test the code you can go to the folder of the day and run the following command:

```bash
go test
```

This will run the tests for the day and you can see the output of the tests.

To run the code and get the answer go to the folder of the day and run the following command:

```bash
go run .
```

This will run the code and print the answer to the console.
