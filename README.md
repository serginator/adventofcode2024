This is my repo for the [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024). I will be solving the puzzles in Golang this year to improve my skills in the language.

To test the code you can go to the folder of the day and run the following commands:

To run the tests:
```bash
go test
```

To run the code:
```bash
go run .
```
